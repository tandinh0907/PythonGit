# PythonGit
PythonGit is a project aimed at creating a simplified version of Git using the Python programming language. This project is intended for educational purposes to help me understand the fundamental concepts behind the Git version control systems.


## Features

- **Basic Core Command**: PythonGit provides a very simplified version of all Git core commands such as: ```add```, ```init```, ```status```, ```commit```, ```rm```, ...
- **Command-Line Interface**: The project comes with a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the version control system. Users can execute commands similar to Git commands for familiarity.
- **Repository Management**: PythonGit allows users to initialize repositories, add files, and view the status of changes in a repository as well as explore the commit history, view commit details.


## Getting Started
To get started with PythonGit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/tandinh0907/PythonGit`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd PythonGit`
3. Run the PythonGit CLI to execute version control commands by either run the `wyag.py` file or make the `wyag.py` file become a executable file and run it
## Usage
Here are some basic examples of PythonGit commands (can use `wyag commands` if you make the file executable):

- Initialize a new repository: `python wyag.py init our_repo_name`
- Add files to the staging area: `python wyag.py add filename`
- Commit changes: `python wyag.py commit -m "Your commit message"`
