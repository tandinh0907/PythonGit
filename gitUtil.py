#between the last and the upcoming commit. Git uses index file to represent the staging area.

#Index file can be consider as a three-way association list: not only paths with blobs,
#but also paths with actual filesystem entries. 

#Index file has a important feature that is different from tree: it can represent 
#inconsistent states, like a merge conflict, whereas a tree is always a complete,
#unambiguous representation.

#When commit, git will turn the index file into a new tree object by:
#   _When the repository is "clean", the index file holds the exact same content
#    as the HEAD commit, plus metadata about the corresponding filesystems entries.
#   _When use git add and git rm, the index file is modified accordingly by 
#    updating the index file with a new blob ID and the various file metadata will
#    update as well so git status knows when not to compare file contents.
#   _When use git commit on those changes, a new tree is produced from the index file,
#    a new commit object is generated with that tree, branches are updated and we're done.
